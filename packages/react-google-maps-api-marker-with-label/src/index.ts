 * @name MarkerWithLabel for V3
 * @version 1.2.3
 * @author Gary Little (inspired by code from Marc Ridey of Google).

 * @fileoverview MarkerWithLabel extends the Google Maps JavaScript API V3
 *  <code>google.maps.Marker</code> class.
 *  <p>
 *  MarkerWithLabel allows you to define markers with associated labels. As you would expect,
 *  if the marker is draggable, so too will be the label. In addition, a marker with a label
 *  responds to all mouse events in the same manner as a regular marker. It also fires mouse
 *  events and "property changed" events just as a regular marker would.
